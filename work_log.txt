Db handler and Mysql lock module working. Next make resource locker module use database handler

In Resource Locker module, redirected to connect_to_database script in mysql_db_handler folder 

ResourceLockerRequestHandler works. Just returns simple strings. Make EditButtonClickHandler return json

Solved major bugs:
1. Didnt reload ResourceLocker.js from cache. Was still calling edit_button_click_handler.php script and not index.php?page=edit_button_click_handler

2. Had .php at the end in index.php?page=edit_button_click_handler.php

3. Mysql error: 
ResourceLocker::tryDeleteLock error: Table 'resource_locks' was not locked with LOCK TABLES
To print error use mysqli_error($db_conn)

Next: Fix this LOCK TABLES issue. Then call index.php?page= resource_lock pages. 

LOCK TABLES works! Next call index.php?page= resource_lock pages. 

Strange: Resource remanis locked even though update_resource_latest time is not working yet. Answer: EditButtonClickHandler locks the resource and it takes 10 secnods before tryDeleteLock works.

UpdateResourceLatestTime now works! Next UnlockNotChangedResource

ResourceLocker module transformation of scripts into index.php?page= is now complete

Join team info done. Working on create task submit buttons

Problem: newSubtaskId and parentTaskId get set in getContent method. But we need access to them in getAddToHead method. It would work if getAddToHead is called after getContent but this is not good programming to rely on this. Idea: Create a preHandle function in SkeletonPage. Calculating parentTaskId needs access to $this->taskType and so on. So setTaskParams must be called before preHandle. Steps:
1. Add preHandle to Page.php
2. call $page->preHandler in index.php
3. Move logic to preHandle function. At the end do:
$this->newSubtaskId = newSubtaskId and $this->parentTaskId = $parentTaskId

CreateTaskSubmit buttons work! Next fix JoinTeamSubmit button

JoinTeamSubmit button works!

Forgot to set $this->taskId in LeaveTaskSubmit preHandle function.
