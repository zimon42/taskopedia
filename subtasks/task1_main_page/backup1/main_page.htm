	<h1 id=about_taskopedia_title>About taskopedia:</h1>
	<p>Taskopedia is a platform where people come together to solve complex tasks. There is currently only one task at Taskopedia: Finding treatments for DIPG cancer, see above. All computer resources will be focused on solving this task. Perhaps in the future more tasks can be added. 
	</p>
	<p>The strenghts with Taskopedia are:
		<ol>
			<li>Dividing tasks into subtasks. I don't like using war metaphores but it was Julius Caesar who coined the expression "Divide and conquer". By breaking a task down into smaller subtasks, solving the task becomes more manageable.</li>
			<li>People coming together. After having broken the task into subtasks, different users can be assigned to different tasks, making it possible to solve the task more efficiently, solving subtasks in parallell</li>
